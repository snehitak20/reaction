## Reflection

For this project, it was important to learn the use of React. It is important to learn what is considered to be professional on LinkedIn and GitHub, and how to create a true professional portfolio that is reflective of me. The key star here is Bootstrap for helping with the webpage layout.  This website stands out because it is a true professional portfolio that is reflective of my goals.
